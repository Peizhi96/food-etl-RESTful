        - `review`: Stores customer reviews and ratings.
        - `location`: Contains information about the restaurantâ€™s location.
    - Loaded these tables into a PostgreSQL database.

3. **Cloud Deployment**:
    - Deployed the project on Azure, using Azure Data Factory for data processing.
    - Created a CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps to automate cloud deployment.
   - Uploaded the data files to Databricks for further processing.
